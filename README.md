# fractal

Fract-ol is a project from 42 School that explores fractal generation using the MiniLibX graphical library. The goal is to render beautiful fractals such as the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, allowing user interaction to zoom, move, and modify the fractals dynamically.

You can interact with the fractals using the following keyboard and mouse controls:

* ESC: Close the window and exit the program.

* Arrow Keys: Move the view of the fractal up, down, left, or right.

* Mouse Wheel: Zoom in and out of the fractal.

* 'R' Key: Reset the fractal to its initial state.

* 'C' Key: Change the color scheme of the fractal.

* 'J' Key: Generate a new Julia set with random parameters.

* 'M' Key: Decrease the number of iterations, reducing the detail of the fractal.

* 'P' Key: Increase the number of iterations, increasing the detail of the fractal.
